Fractal-Mosaics
===============

# Prerequisites

Fractal Mosaics is implemented in Matlab.  You’ll need a copy of Matlab with the Signal Processing toolbox installed (most versions should come with this).

# Getting Started

1.  Download the demo example.  This has all the code you need.  Simply modify the example to create your own mosaics.
2.	Download the example image set (706 MB database of images of San Francisco).
3.	Unpack zip file with images into the /library_images folder in the demo example.
4.	Navigate to the /m-files directory 
5.	Run ‘fractal_mosaic.m’ 

Your mosaic is now rendering.

Warning:  it takes a long time to render a mosaic (~6 to 8 hrs on my macbook pro).  If you want to optimize it, please do ;)

The demo example creates a black and white mosaic.  This is because color takes ~3X as long.  To create a color mosaic, download the color image set, and set Fractal Mosaics to color mode (see the Variables page for info on this).
